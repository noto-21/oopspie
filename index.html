            <p>We've all been there.</p>
            <p>You're set to pull your perfect pie out of the oven, plaid cotton mitts at the ready.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's Apple Pie.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's Pumpkin Pie.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's Pizza Pie.</p>
            <p>Whatever it is, you go to remove it from the oven, and when you do, you fumble like the clumsy chef you are and the pie falls face-first onto the ground.</p>
            <p>Dead.</p>
            <p>You freeze in shock as your heart-rate increases.  Adrenaline surges through your bloodstream as you gaze in mortified awe at the tragedy you have just allowed to unfold.</p>
            <p>"I'm a monster", you think to yourself.  "How could I have let this happen?"</p>
            <p>As guilt surges through your central nervous system, you hurriedly grab a fork from your kitchen drawer and begin to shovel whatever remains you can salvage off of the kitchen floor into your pie-hole.</p>
            <p>How sad.</p>
